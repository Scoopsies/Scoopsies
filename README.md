# Hello, I'm Scoopsies

## Software Craftsman | Polyglot Developer | Clean Code Advocate
I'm a software craftsman who builds maintainable, well-tested systems regardless of language or paradigm. I recently completed 2 years at Clean Coders, where I trained under Micah Martin in an environment shaped by Robert C. Martin's (Uncle Bob) clean code principles, delivering custom solutions for diverse clients. I'm now seeking my next opportunity to apply these principles with a team that values craftsmanship.

### What I Believe

**Principles over tools.** Good software design transcends language. Whether I'm writing Clojure, Java, Python, Go, or JavaScript, I apply the same rigorous approach: comprehensive test coverage, SOLID design, and code that communicates intent.

**Tests are not optional.** I practice Test-Driven Development because tests are both specification and safety net. They enable confident refactoring and sustainable velocity.

**Code is for humans.** The compiler doesn't care about readability, but your teammates do. I write code that reveals intent and minimizes cognitive load.

### What I'm Looking For

I'm seeking teams and projects where:
- Code quality and automated testing are non-negotiable
- Software design is a first-class concern
- Continuous learning is encouraged
- Craftsmanship matters more than credentials

I'm technology-agnostic. I care more about building it right than building it in a specific language.
